<h2 class="a" style="text-align:center"><b> What you hope to get out of this class:</b></h2>
<p class="b" style="text-align:center">I hope to learn how to make a website look good and stylish.</p>
 
<h2  class="a" style="text-align:center"><b>Why you became interested in computers and programming.</b></h2>
<p class="b"  style="text-align:center">My dad was a programmer, so it came pretty naturally. Also, the idea of bending a recalcitrant machine into a useful tool is pretty facinating.</p>

<h2 class="a" style="text-align:center"><b>Your goals after graduating from Tri-C.</b></h2>
<p  class="b" style="text-align:center">I have a lot of goals, and their order change pretty much every week. Right now, I've been focusing on practicing music and painting, but I also eventually want to publish a book and get a job in IT.</p>

<h2  class="a" style="text-align:center"><b>One or two 'big dream' goals. (Feasibility not required).</b></h2>
<p  class="b" style="text-align:center">One of my big dreams is to write my own music, and play it live somewhere. Another is to have enough free time to do everything that I actually want to do (haha).</p>

<h2  class="a" style="text-align:center"><b>A picture of yourself, or a photo that you feel represents you well enough.</b></h2>

<p  class="b" style="text-align:center">This is a picture of my boyfriend and I. Well, of our shadow.</p>
